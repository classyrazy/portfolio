        <p>Like every human, I have hobbies and interests. I've always been curious about things on computers and how we just go to google and ask anything and that google guy will give answers like he is the greatest professor of all time (LMAO).Like most of us we have once set our future ambition as doctors followed by pilot and we later become another thing in life. I had that similar problem when I was going into senior secondary school when I couldn't decide whether to go to science department or humanity or commercial I was actually compelled to go to science but with time I realised that it was the best place for me.</p>
        <p>My journey in programming started in 2019 when I finished my Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination(SSCE) I visited my uncle at Oshogbo(the CEO of Macroware ltd) and he started teaching me a little bit of Java script and since then I fell in love with programming but due to the rushing of resumption and the stress of school I had to reduce the way I code.But thank God for giving me the opportunity to start coding again. </p>
